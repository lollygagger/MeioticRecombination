#Meiotic Recombination Model

This is a basic python program which models an extremely simplified version of crossing over during prophase I of meiosis. This model was created for an introduction to biology class research poster. This model includes variables for population size, number of chromosomes per individual, number of genes per chromosome, the number of generations modeled, the mutation rate, and a boolean for whether or not crossing over takes place.
